## Overview
This dashboard provides a visual overview of **road traffic crashes in Queensland, Australia**, from **2001 to 2023**. It aims to give insights into the **trends, severity, nature, and contributing factors** of these crashes. The dashboard includes several key components:

- **Total Crashes Over Year**: A line graph showing the total number of traffic crashes per year.
- **Crash Severity by Location**: A map highlighting Queensland, with a table summarizing crash severity categories (Fatal, Minor Injury, Property Damage Only, Hospitalization, Medical Treatment).
- **Crash Nature**: A bar chart displaying the frequency of different crash types (e.g., Angle, Rear-end, Hit Object).
- **Road Conditions by Location**: A horizontal bar chart categorizing crashes based on road conditions (Sealed-Dry, Sealed-Wet, Unsealed-Dry, Unsealed-Wet) across Queensland regions.

## Observations & Key Insights

### **1. Overall Crash Trends**
- The total number of crashes has fluctuated over the years, with peaks and declines.
- A general **downward trend** in crashes is observed after **2015**.
- The dataset records **386.84K total traffic crashes**.

### **2. Crash Severity**
- **Medical treatment and hospitalization** are the most common outcomes, indicating a high number of injury-related crashes.
- **Property damage-only** crashes are also significant.
- **Fatal crashes**, while less frequent, still total **5,850 cases**.

### **3. Crash Nature**
- **Angle crashes** are the most frequent, followed by **rear-end** and **hit object** crashes.
- Other crash types include **hit pedestrian, hit animal, and head-on collisions**.
- The **"Other" category** is relatively high, indicating the need for better classification.

### **4. Road Conditions**
- The **majority of crashes occur on sealed roads**, especially when dry.
- **Sealed roads with wet conditions** also see a significant number of crashes, highlighting the impact of **weather** on road safety.
- **Brisbane and the North Coast** report the highest number of crashes related to road conditions.

### **5. Geographic Distribution**
- The dashboard visualizes the **geographic distribution of crashes** across Queensland.
- The **southeast of Queensland** was the most heavily affected area.
- More granular data on regional crash rates could improve targeted safety measures.

## **Strategic Recommendations**

### **1. Target High-Frequency Crash Types**
- Implement **improved intersection design and traffic signal optimization** to reduce **angle and rear-end collisions**.
- Prevent **hit object crashes** by clearing roadside hazards and improving signage.

### **2. Address Weather-Related Crashes**
- Develop strategies to reduce crashes on **wet roads**, including:
  - Improved **road surface treatments**.
  - Enhanced **drainage systems**.
  - Public awareness campaigns on **safe driving in wet conditions**.

### **3. Enhance Data Granularity**
- Provide more **detailed crash location data** (e.g., specific intersections or road segments).
- **Break down the "Other" crash category** for better understanding and classification.

### **4. Improve Data Collection and Reporting**
- Ensure **consistent and accurate data collection** across Queensland.
- **Standardize crash reporting** for better comparison and analysis.

### **5. Public Awareness Campaigns**
- Conduct **targeted campaigns** to educate drivers on:
  - **Common crash types** and how to avoid them.
  - **Risky driving behaviors**.
  - **Safe driving practices**.

### **6. Infrastructure Improvements**
- Invest in **road safety enhancements**, such as:
  - **Intersection upgrades**.
  - **Road widening projects**.
  - **Improved road signage and markings**.

### **7. Focus on High-Risk Areas**
- Given **Brisbane and the North Coast** report the highest crash rates, prioritizing these areas in safety initiatives will be beneficial.
